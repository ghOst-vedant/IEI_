      <Text marginStart={"50"} fontSize="2xl">
      FCRIT was established in 1994, named after late Rev. Fr. Conceicao
      Rodrigues. FCRIT persistently seeks and adopts innovative methods to
      improve the quality of education on a consistent basis. The global standards set
      at FCRIT in the field of teaching spurs the students in relentless pursuit of
      excellence. Though its reputation rests mainly on the high quality, value-based
      technical education that it imparts, it has to its credit a verdant, well-maintained
      Campus and extensive facilities. Its location in the vicinity of the holy places of
      various religious denominations underscores its secular credentials and its
      philosophy of "Vasudhaiva Kuttumbakam". The college prides on being one of
      few that has accreditation for all five branches.
